# Nutrition & Fruit Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project focuses on **fruit classification and nutrition prediction** using various **machine learning and deep learning algorithms**.  
The system analyzes fruit images, predicts the fruit type, and provides corresponding **nutritional information** based on the trained model.

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an **intelligent fruit detection system** that:
- Classifies fruit images accurately.
- Predicts nutritional values.
- Compares performance across multiple ML/DL algorithms.
- Provides a user-friendly web interface for interaction.

The project integrates **Python-based model training** and a **Flask web application** for deployment.
